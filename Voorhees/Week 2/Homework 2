##The plan

I plan to forecast bikeshare demand in Washington D.C. (Capitol Bikeshare system). This is a Kaggle playground project titled "Forecast use of a city bikeshare system." 

##The dataset 

I have two datasets containing information about weather and time, each spanning the course of two years. The first dataset contains data for the first 19 days of a given month, and has data on bike demand; it will be the dataset I use to develop my forecasting model. The second dataset contains all the rest of the data for the month, but without any information related to demand demand; it is the dataset that will be sent and scored by Kaggle (using RMSLE) after I estimate fitted demand for it. 


##Data facts and caveats

I know I will have to, at least, process the time variable in the dataset, so to make useful statements about how different aspects of time (hour, day of week, etc.) affect demand.



##Why I'm interested
I chose this topic because it gives me the chance to explore a variety of forecasting tools.
