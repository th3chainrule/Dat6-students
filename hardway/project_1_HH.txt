A key performance indicator for retail banks is the length of time customers wait in line before their transactions are processed.  Yet, often customers only show up in the data at the completion of their transaction (i.e. when they receive their receipt).  While new technology exists, such at security cameras enabled with tracking capabilities, such infrastructure is the exception, not the norm, at your neighborhood retail bank.  

As an analyst for the bank division of CaptialOne (and generous tuition recipient for this class from said company), my project will be tied to understanding customer wait times and/or the happiness of customers with their wait.  A major obstacle is the lack of wait time data – only transactional data exists.  One possibility includes pulling Twitter data and tying this to transactional data.  Can the unhappy customers be tied back to a specific branch location, or a specific time?  However, the clack of bank specific CaptialOne tweets (most are related to the credit card line of business), and further, the lack of wait time specific tweets could make this analysis infeasible.  

A second possibility would be to instead try to predict in advance times and locations where customers wait too long and are dissatisfied with their service.  A bank can be thought of as a basic queuing model – with three key parameters, arrival rate, service time, and number of servers available.  Wait times increase if each of the parameters is independently varied – if arrival or service time increases, or if the  number of servers decreases.  Looking at historic data, it may be possible to identify times in which the  arrival rate is higher than forecasted.
